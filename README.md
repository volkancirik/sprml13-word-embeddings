sprml13-word-embeddings
=======================

25 Dimensional Word Embeddings for the Shared Task of SPRML 2013

use german2.embeddings for better coverage. german.embeddings are
used in the SPRML'13 Shared Task submission.

For english,use  [seed number]english50.embeddings or [seed number]english50+f.embeddings.
The first one is extracted without morphologic and ortographic features. The second
one is extracted with morphologic and ortographic features.
